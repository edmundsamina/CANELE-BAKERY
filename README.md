# **Canele-Bakery** 🥐🍞🥞🥯🥖

This small side projected was completed over a one week sprint, but was staggered to allow us to work on other things during the week too. We wanted to create a sophisticated french bakery website to help us review useContext, react router. As well as learn about cacheing, MongoDb and persisiting state. Our basic MVP is functional and we added some moments of joy for the user, through a loader when filtering the bakery items!
